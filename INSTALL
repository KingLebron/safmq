	To Install SAFMQ do the following steps

UNIX Installation:
	1) Download the SAFMQ source tarbal OR zip
	2) run:
			./configure

		NOTE: Use the --prefix option to configure to specify the install
			location, the default is /usr/local (bin,lib,include)

		NOTE: If your operating system is FreeBSD or a dirivative, please
			use gmake instead of make.

	3) Make a safmq.conf, there's one in the "sample" directory, put it in /etc or
		where ever you like
	4) Make directories for the queues and configuation data from your safmq.conf (these
		may be the same directory)
	5) Launch safmq, if you issue the "-D" parameter it will start in the background.

Win32 Installation:
	NOTE: to use SSL in Win32 situation, install OpenSSL on you system and
		add the out32 (for libraries) and inc32 (for include files) directories to the
		"Directories" tab in the VisualStudio "Options" dialog.

	1) Download the SAFMQ source tarbal OR zip
	2) Open safmq.dsw and build
	3) Depending on the build selection, safmq.exe will be created, and safmqc.exe
		will also be created.
	4) copy safmq.exe and safmqc.exe to your favorite installation locations like
		%SystemRoot%\system32 or where ever you like
	5) Make a safmq.conf, there's one in the "sample" directory, put it in %SystemRoot%
		(c:\windows) or where ever you like. (NOTE: If you plan to run SAFMQ as a service
		putting safmq.conf in %SystemRoot% is essential).
	6) Make directories for the queues and configuation data from your safmq.conf (these
		may be the same directory)
	7) Optionally Install the service
	8) Run safmq by issuing the command "safmq".  If you've installed as a service, the
		"-D" parameter will start the service, othewise it will run in the foreground.

	- OR -

	Download the binary distribution .MSI file and install directly.  You'll still need
	to configure where you want your queue files, etc.

Operation:	
       -h,--help      : Show this information
       -c cfg,
       --config=cfg   : Use 'cfg' as the configuration file
       -D,--daemon    : Start the program in the background

In WinNT based platforms (WinNT, WinXP, Win2K, WIn2K3) only:
       -i,--install   : Installs SAFMQ as a service
       -r,--remove    : Uninstalls SAFMQ as a service

Security Concerns:
	NOTE: SAFMQ users and passwords are stored in plain text.  It is essential that
		the directory specified by "config_dir" be readable only by the user running
		safmq.
